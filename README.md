<h1>Alpha-monoGames</h1>

Welcome to Alpha monoGames, a fun to earn and play blockchain gaming ecosystem. We want to be an ecosystem where players, developers and investors can all participate and earn in unique ways. We understand the needs of players who love to play and earn, we understand developers who love to build games and we know how precious time is to investors. We want to create a balancing act so we all can build a sustainable evolutionary gaming ecosystem together.

Our first objective is to get gamers on board with the play to earn nft games we at monoGames create. Gamers will have the option to earn and hold or sell their rewards on the in game market or their faction (coin/token) market place. We want to introduce monoGames Community Games where any developer(s) can build and introduce their games to the monoGames ecosystem. Part of the tokenomics of monoGames is we have funds available over 5 years which can be paid daily or monthly to developers who build games. Finally we want investors to know we are an ever evolving ecosystem partnering with gamers and developers to build the next generation of fun to play and earn nft blockchain games where they can support the community by staking large amounts of developer tokens and nftcryptomix tokens for daily rewards issued in the tokenomics of the game (monoGames tokens), nft packs, 50 land packages, all nft's at max level and special privalages. 

monoGames is more than building games we are about creating opportunities to give value for everyone in the ecosystem the way they want to earn. We are open to ideas and if you have any then please reach out to our <a href="https://discord.gg/5V4Y7y2gwV">discord</a> and let us know, we would love the feed back because monoGames is more than just games "were building a sustainable gaming ecosystem together with our ever evolving community".
